# USB-Roulette
This is a fun little script designed to work with the [picoducky](https://github.com/Outdatedcandy92/PicoDucky). 
What this does is simple. At the press of a button, it will cycle through colors on the LED and depending on the one that it lands on, it will do a different thing utilizing the keyboard.
These pranks can range from simply taking a screenshot, to locking your PC.
